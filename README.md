 <h1 align="center">Calculation Bot</h1>


-Hello,I made a Discord Bot for your basic math operations.

-I used Visual Studio Code as editor and discord.py as library.

-New features will come with updates,take a look to <a href="https://github.com/451EK/CalculationBot/blob/main/current--version">current--version</a> file to see current bot version.  

-You can come to our <a href="https://discord.gg/YftvCvgPdy">Support Server</a> to give suggestion or get support and information.


<h2>Requirements</h2>

-You have to have <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.5/python-3.9.5-amd64.exe">Python(3.9.x)</a> downloaded in your computer.

-You need a code editor(actually you can edit your code in your default text editor but using another text editor will be easier),I used Visual Studio Code so I recommend you to install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.

-After you installed Visual Studio Code,open the terminal with `Ctrl+Shift+"` and watch the following gif:

<h2>Hosting The Bot</h2>

-This may be the most difficult step because it is hard to host the bot correctly.

-I hosted my bot on <a href="replit.com">Repl.it</a>,you can use another site but this one is more reliable for me.

-Of course,the bot will down when you turn off your pc so you need to keep your bot 24/7 online.I do this with using my Tablet when I'm sleeping,just copy your repl.it link and open that in your device,That's all!
